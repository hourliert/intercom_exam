## Proudest Achievement

I am really proud of all my github projects. Especially [this grapqhl client for dart](https://github.com/hourliert/graphql_client).
I have the feeling that I did my best to write something really beautiful, useful and maintainable.

This is the first GraphQL Client for dart "ever" and I am happy to publish it "open sourcely" to the community.

I apply myself to use dart best practices and had to use a lot of high-level concepts (like neat POO, code generation, etc.).

This project is already used by some dart users and some friends. I am happy to resolve their issues and make this
project better everyday.

These personal projects are not "big" things neither my everyday job. But I can appreciate my progression when
I am reading their code and see that I have progressed over the past 12 years.

## Flatten Array

You could see the code at [here](lib/src/flatten.dart).
Tests have been written for these functions and are available [here](test/flatten_test.dart).

I am thinking to a final optimization to this algorithm: to pass a result array in the function
and update this result array on each recursion step. That would reduce even more the memory 
used.

## User Locator

You could see the code at [here](lib/src/user_locator.dart). And example is runnable and available [here](bin/main.dart);
Tests have been written for these functions and are available [here](test/earth_position_test.dart), check this folder to see more tests.
